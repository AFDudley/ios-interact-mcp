# Fullscreen Mode Removal Summary

## Overview
Removed the requirement for fullscreen mode in the OCR controller, allowing all operations (screenshot, text finding, clicking) to work in windowed mode. This simplifies the code and improves user experience by avoiding disruptive fullscreen transitions.

## Key Changes

### 1. `ios_interact_mcp/ocr_controller_functional.py`
- **Removed fullscreen state management**: 
  - Deleted `ensure_fullscreen()` and `exit_fullscreen()` calls from all functions
  - Removed `state_changed` tracking throughout
  - Simplified `observe_simulator()` to not check fullscreen menu state
  
- **Fixed coordinate transformation bug**:
  - Changed `click_text_in_simulator` to use correct screenshot pixel bounds (0,0 to width,height) instead of window bounds
  - This ensures OCR coordinates are properly transformed to screen coordinates

### 2. `ios_interact_mcp/server.py`
- **Updated imports**: Changed from class-based `ocr_controller` to functional `ocr_controller_functional`
- **Adapted function calls**: Updated all tool implementations to use the functional controller
- **Removed exception handling**: Let exceptions propagate naturally as requested

### 3. `tests/test_e2e_simulator.py`
- **Removed fullscreen-specific tests**:
  - Deleted `test_windowed_mode_restoration` (no longer needed)
  - Deleted `test_visual_confirmation` (tested fullscreen transitions)
  
- **Updated remaining tests**:
  - Removed all fullscreen state checks and logging
  - Removed screenshot dimension comparisons with screen size
  - Simplified test output to focus on functionality rather than window state

## Benefits
1. **Faster operations**: No fullscreen transitions means quicker execution
2. **Less disruptive**: User can continue working while tests run
3. **Simpler code**: Removed complex state management and restoration logic
4. **Better compatibility**: Works with any simulator window size
5. **More reliable**: Fewer moving parts means fewer potential failures

## Technical Details
- Screenshots are now taken at actual window size (e.g., 608x1277) instead of full screen
- All coordinate transformations work with actual window bounds
- OCR text detection works identically in windowed mode
- Click operations use proper coordinate space transformations

## Verified Functionality
All e2e tests pass, confirming that:
- ✅ Screenshot capture works in windowed mode
- ✅ OCR text finding works correctly
- ✅ Click operations (both text and coordinate-based) work properly
- ✅ Navigation between screens functions as expected
- ✅ System adapts to different window sizes automatically
