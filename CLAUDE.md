# iOS Simulator Interaction via MCP Server

## Current Session Summary (2025-01-24)

### Work Completed

1. **Removed Non-Existent Features**
   - ✅ Removed `tap` and `swipe` commands that don't exist in `xcrun simctl`
   - ✅ Updated documentation to remove references to these commands

2. **Implemented ocrmac Integration (Partial)**
   - ✅ Window detection using osascript (`SimulatorWindowManager`)
   - ✅ Screenshot capture via `screencapture` command
   - ✅ OCR text finding using ocrmac library (`OCRTextFinder`)
   - ✅ Added `list_simulator_windows` tool
   - ✅ Added `find_text_in_simulator` tool

### Current State

The server now has:
- Working window detection for simulators
- Screenshot capture of specific simulator windows
- OCR capability to find text in screenshots
- No broken tap/swipe functionality

### Completed Features

1. ✅ **Click Functionality (Step 4)**
   - Implemented osascript-based clicking at screen coordinates
   - Added coordinate transformation from screenshot space to screen space
   - Tested clicking on actual UI elements (General button in Settings)

2. ✅ **Integrated click_text Tool (Step 5)**
   - Combined OCR text finding with clicking
   - Handles multiple text matches with occurrence parameter
   - Supports simulator targeting for multiple simulators

3. ✅ **Core MCP Tools Available**
   - `click_text` - Click on text found via OCR
   - `click_at_coordinates` - Click at specific screen coordinates
   - `find_text_in_simulator` - Find text elements using OCR
   - `list_simulator_windows` - List all simulator windows

### Remaining Tasks

1. **xcrun command passthrough for copy/paste** (Low priority)
2. **Enhanced error handling** (Low priority)
3. **Performance optimizations** (Future enhancement)

### Important Files to Read

When continuing this work, read these files in order:

1. **OSASCRIPT_PLAN.md** - Overview of the osascript integration approach
2. **OCRMAC_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Detailed plan for ocrmac integration
3. **ios_interact_server.py** - Current implementation with partial ocrmac support
4. **test_*.py** - Test files showing how each component works

### Known Issues

- ✅ Fixed: OCR tuple format parsing corrected
- ✅ Fixed: Coordinate transformation implemented  
- ✅ Fixed: Click functionality working
- ⚠️ Minor: Success detection for osascript clicks could be improved
- Note: Permissions must be granted for osascript to control System Events

### Dependencies

```bash
pip install mcp ocrmac
```

### Testing Progress

- ✅ Window detection tested and working
- ✅ Screenshot capture tested and working  
- ✅ OCR library installed and integrated
- ✅ OCR text finding working with proper tuple format parsing
- ✅ Click functionality implemented and tested
- ✅ Coordinate transformation working (screenshot to screen coordinates)
- ✅ Full integration tested (OCR → coordinate transform → click)

### Architecture Notes

The approach uses:
1. **osascript** - For window management and clicking
2. **screencapture** - For capturing simulator windows
3. **ocrmac** - For OCR text detection
4. **No simctl tap** - This command doesn't exist, using osascript instead

This avoids relying on non-existent simctl commands while providing robust UI automation.

### Platform Requirements

**This codebase is macOS-specific and will always target macOS only.** The implementation relies on:
- AppleScript/osascript for UI automation
- macOS-specific screenshot tools
- System Events accessibility permissions
- iOS Simulator (macOS exclusive)

No cross-platform compatibility is needed or planned.
